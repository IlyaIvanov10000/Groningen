## Overview

This code is used for the analysis of the population dynamics of the **RootPatch** GM _B. mycoides_, the Wild-type _B. mycoides_, and their interactions with each other and the environment. The code defines a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that represent the bacterial population over time. Additionally it predicts the influence of different parameters on the bacterial population dynamics, and it shows the model shows visual outcome of the solved ODEs. The code is validated based on the Ratkowski square root equation, Lotka-Volterra competition equations, and the diffusion of the bacteria.

## Instruction to using the model

The model contains three files. Prior to working with them you need to download the Mathematica package. The files should be opened with Mathematica. Use "Shift-Enter" to run the code, start with running the Quit[] to clear the previous calculations.

### File #1. Population_Manipulation_And_Bifurcation

Contains the overall bacterial population plots, where the bacterial density can be plotted over time throughout the season. This file also contains the manipulate plots, which could be used to see the impact of changing a certain parameter on the bacterial density course. The biggest part of this file are the bifurcation plots for each parameter. The Bifurcation plots shows the population of the bacteria after 150 days, when changing one parameter (x-axis).

### File #2. Different_Initial_Population 

Contains the code that can be used to effect of changing the starting bacterial density upon application to the soil on the fluctuations of the bacterial density throughout the season. 

### File #3. Sensitivity_Analysis_Parameters

Contains the code used for the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis evaluates to what extent can a change in a parameter (e.g., 2%) affect the end population of GM _B. mycoides_.
