The population dynamics models focusing on the Globodera pallida nematode and the (RootPatch) bacterial population on the roots. 

## RootPatch - What is it?

**RootPatch** is an innovative technology developed by iGEM-Groningen to protect the potato plants from the _Globodera pallida_ nematodes. **RootPatch** is an easy-to-use, targeted, and environmentally friendly product for crop protection in agriculture. It is a bacterial (_Bacillus mycoides_) community that forms a biofilm-like structure on the surface of potato roots. The bacteria will produce and secrete NLP-14a, a neuropeptide-like protein, native to _G. pallida_. After taking up NLP-14a, it will reverse the chemoattraction of the nematodes to the roots,repelling the harmful parasites away from the plant. 

## RootPatch - Motivation

Potatoes are beloved in the Netherlands, being part of many national dishes. Moreover, potatoes are an important export crop for the Dutch economy. We were worried to realize that the _G. pallida_ problem is very prominent in the Netherlands compared to other EU countries. The current measures include crop rotation, use of nematicides, and genetic breeding but these approaches are either neglected, are harmful to the environment, or take a very long time to implement. Therefore, our aim is to develop an efficient and reliable crop protection technology that is least harmful to the soil biome and the environment. 

## Modelling approach

Our modelling efforts this year were directed towards understanding the dynamics of the nematode populations, their effect on the plant,
